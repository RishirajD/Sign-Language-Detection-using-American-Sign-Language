# Sign-Language-Detection-using-Inception V3, American Sign Language
Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning with InceptionV3 enables real-time ASL recognition via a webcam. It preprocesses hand gestures, predicts letters with a trained model, and forms words/sentences dynamically. Optimized for performance, it ensures efficient, accurate gesture recognition in Python.
Steps to follow :- 
1. Capture real-time video frames using OpenCV.  
2. Extract the Region of Interest (ROI) for hand gestures.  
3. Preprocess ROI (resize, normalize).  
4. Predict the ASL letter using the InceptionV3 model.  
5. Store predictions, build words/sentences dynamically.  
6. Display results with FPS optimization.
This ASL recognition project successfully detects and translates American Sign Language gestures using the InceptionV3 model. It enables real-time interpretation, sentence formation, and an intuitive user interface. Despite its efficiency, improvements can enhance accuracy and usability. Future enhancements include expanding the dataset for better generalization, integrating NLP for context-based predictions, and optimizing inference speed using TensorRT or ONNX. Adding multi-hand detection, gesture flow analysis, and mobile app deployment can further improve accessibility. Incorporating AI-driven predictive text suggestions and voice output will enhance communication for the hearing-impaired community, making the system more versatile and user-friendly.
